## What is our WebApp?

Our WebApp is designed to help users practice and improve their interview skills. When prompted, users will speak into the microphhone and answer 3 generic interview questions. The app will record the interview and breakdown the answer given, giving a rating based on specified critera and words used. Then, it is compared to other user attempts to give a comparison and return statistics of the prompted user.
